			<h1>TMBAG Arena</h1>
			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>This Might Be a Game Arena (TMBAG Arena) is a game written in JavaScript, using the <a href="http://pixijs.com">Pixi.js</a> library. The code is based loosely on the original TMBAG, which is a text-based RPG written in Python. All code and art assets &copy; Nathan Gunzenhauser/IAMVISHNU/griffenx. This project was created by Nathan Gunzenhauser for a JavaScript class. Like this project? Check out my <a href="http://github.com/griffenx">GitHub</a> page.</p>
			<h2>How to Play</h2>
			<p>Playing the game is simple! Just click on the text prompts to navigate the game. The Battle.Log will keep a brief record of past actions, however if you ever want to view the full game log, bring up the JavaScript console (usually with F12) for a full record of all battle events.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're running this game from your own computer, you'll need to use some sort of local webserver, otherwise the game won't load properly (it's a WebGL thing, don't complain to me about it). If you have <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> installed, simply open up a command prompt/terminal inside this game's directory, then type <code>python -m http.server</code> and navigate your browser to <a href="localhost:8000"><code>localhost:8000</code></a>.</p>
