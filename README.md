# TMBAG-Arena
## About
This Might Be a Game Arena (TMBAG Arena) is a game written in JavaScript, using the [Pixi.js](http://pixijs.com) library. The code is based loosely on the original TMBAG, which is a text-based RPG written in Python. All code and art assets Â© Nathan Gunzenhauser/IAMVISHNU/griffenx. This project was created by Nathan Gunzenhauser for a JavaScript class.

## How to play
Playing the game is simple! Just click on the text prompts to navigate the game. The Battle.Log will keep a brief record of past actions, however if you ever want to view the full game log, bring up the JavaScript console (usually with F12) for a full record of all battle events.

### Online
The game can be accessed online at [the github page for this repo](http://griffenx.github.io/TMBAG-Arena). No downloading required!

### Locally
If you're running this game from your own computer, you'll need to use some sort of local webserver, otherwise the game won't load properly (it's a WebGL thing, don't complain to me about it). If you have Python installed, simply open up a command prompt/terminal inside this game's directory, then type `python -m http.server` and navigate your browser to `localhost:8000`.
